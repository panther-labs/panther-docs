# Data Analytics

## Overview

Panther's Data Analytics allow for freely searching collected and normalized log data using SQL in a [Snowflake](https://docs.panther.com/data-analytics/backend/snowflake) security data lake. As Panther ingests data, we parse, normalize and store that data in Snowflake, which is necessary for investigations, baselining behaviors, writing rules, and generating analytics on logs in the context of days, weeks, or months of data.

## Panther's Data Analytics

### Standard Fields

Panther's log analysis applies normalization fields (IPs, domains, etc) to all log records. These fields standardize names for attributes across all data sources enabling fast and easy data correlation. For more information, see [Standard Fields](panther-fields.md).

### Indicator Search

Panther's Indicator Search runs quick investigations on [common indicators](panther-fields.md#indicator-fields) across various data sources. Indicator Search removes the need to write SQL to answer common questions about suspicious activity and presents results in a simple visualization. For more information, see [Indicator Search](indicator-search.md).

### Data Explorer

Panther's Data Explorer allows you to view normalized data and perform SQL queries with autocompletion. With Data Explorer, you can browse log data and rule matches, search standard fields across data, manage queries, create scheduled queries, select JSON rows to use as unit tests, share results with your team through a link, and download results in a CSV. For more information, see [Data Explorer.](data-explorer.md)

### Saved Queries

Panther's Saved Queries allows you to save, view, manage, load, update, and delete queries. Saved Queries simplify the process of building context around alerts, shortening the time and effort it takes to get a fully actionable detection story. Saving custom, reusable queries can make investigations more efficient, allow you to utilize [Scheduled Queries](./#scheduled-queries), and in some cases obviate the need for SQL familiarity in order for fast triage and response. For more information, see [Saved Queries](saved-queries.md).

### Scheduled Queries

Panther's Scheduled Queries allow you to use SQL queries as opposed to streaming data as a feed into Panther's rules engine using Scheduled Rules. As a Scheduled Query runs, if a corresponding [Scheduled Rule](scheduled-queries.md#create-a-scheduled-rule) returns any hits, one or more `Alerts` will be generated from the data and dispatched accordingly. For more information, see [Scheduled Queries](scheduled-queries.md).

### Query History

The Query History page displays the last 30 days of SQL queries run through the Panther UI. Clicking on the query name will send you to the data explorer where you can see the results and rerun the query. For more information, see [Query History](query-history.md).

### Example Queries

From VPC Activities, to IPs by row count, to [Okta login queries](../guides/okta-detections-and-queries.md), and more â€“ browse a list of [Example Queries](example-queries.md) run by real Panther customers.&#x20;

## Available Databases
