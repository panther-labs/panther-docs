# Data Transports

## Overview

A Data Transport is a type of log source that is used to send log types that are not natively supported by Panther. Data Transports aim to successfully process custom data types through Pantherâ€™s log processing pipeline, map existing detections to custom data types, and map data models to custom data types. In addition to using a Data Transport to onboard your custom logs, you'll need to create a [custom schema](../custom-log-types/) to normalize and classify the data.

## Panther Supported Data Transports

Panther currently supports the following Data Transport methods:

* [AWS S3](s3.md)
* [AWS CloudWatch](cwl-source.md)&#x20;
* [AWS SQS](sqs/)
* [AWS SNS](sqs/sns.md)
* [Google Cloud Storage (GCS)](https://docs.runpanther.io/data-onboarding/data-transports/gcs)
