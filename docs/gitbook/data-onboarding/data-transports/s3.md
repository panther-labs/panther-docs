Click **Next**.

### Step 2: Setup IAM role

Panther needs an AWS IAM role with permissions to read objects from your S3 bucket. You may either use Panther's provided CloudFormation templates to create an IAM role by downloading the CloudFormation template (first option in the UI) or launching a CloudFormation stack using the AWS console (second option in the UI). Alternatively, you can create the role yourself and fill in the role ARN in Panther (third option in the UI).

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-01-05 at 10.19.58 AM.png>)

#### Creating an IAM role using AWS Console UI

This option will will redirect you to the AWS console with the template URL pre-filled. The CloudFormation stack will create an AWS IAM role with the minimum required permissions to read objects from your S3 bucket.&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-01-05 at 10.20.49 AM.png>)

#### Creating an IAM role using CloudFormation Template File

This option allows you to download the template and apply it through your own pipeline.&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-01-05 at 10.20.59 AM.png>)

After the CloudFormation stack creation is complete, the role ARN will be visible in the Outputs of the stack.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/cfn-outputs.png)

Fill in the role ARN to Panther and click **Continue Setup**.

#### Creating an IAM role manually or with other automation

You may create the required IAM role manually or through your own automation, and just fill in the role ARN in Panther. Note, the IAM role policy must include at least the statements defined in the below policy (below the screenshot):

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-01-06 at 4.47.05 PM.png>)

```javascript
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": ["s3:GetBucketLocation", "s3:ListBucket"],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        },
        {
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}
```

When the IAM role is ready, fill in the role ARN to Panther and click Continue Setup.

### Step 3: Finish source setup

Once you've successfully set up the IAM role in your AWS console, you should be prompted with a success screen. Any permission errors detected will be surfaced in this screen and you will be asked to try configuring the IAM role again.&#x20;

Once completed, be sure to set up a log drop-off alarm that will alert you if data stops flowing from the log source. Be sure to set an appropriate time interval for when you would like Panther to alert you that the log source is not sending data.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-01-06 at 4.34.07 PM.png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you haven't opted in for Panther-managed notifications, follow the steps below to configure notifications for your S3 bucket.
{% endhint %}

### Data Backup

Once the S3 bucket has been successfully onboarded to Panther and data is flowing, Panther will backup all raw logs for up to 30 days. After 30 days, the logs will be deleted. The raw logs are used for various reasons:

* To backup dropped logs that may have not been successfully normalized and classified in Panther's data processing pipeline

## Set Up Notifications of New Data

Now that Panther has the ability to pull log data, you need to configure your S3 buckets to send [notifications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html) when new data arrives.

We will configure the bucket to send notifications for new files to an SNS topic, which in turn will notify Panther's SQS queue.

### Create SNS Topic

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you already have configured the bucket to send `All object create events` to an SNS topic, proceed to [modify an existing SNS topic](s3.md#modify-an-existing-sns-topic) and subscribe it to Panther's input data queue.
{% endhint %}

First you need to create an SNS Topic and SNS Subscription to notify Panther that new data is ready for processing.

1. Log into the AWS Console of the account that owns the S3 bucket.&#x20;
2. Select the AWS Region where your S3 bucket is located and navigate to the **CloudFormation** console.&#x20;
3. Select **Create Stack** (with new resources).\
   ![](../../.gitbook/assets/setup-sns1.png)\

4.  Under the `Specify template` section, enter the following Amazon S3 URL:\


    ```
    https://panther-public-cloudformation-templates.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/panther-log-processing-notifications/latest/template.yml
    ```

    \
    ![](../../.gitbook/assets/create-sns-topic-2.png)\

5. Specify the following stack details:
   * Stack name: A name of your choice, e.g. `panther-log-processing-notifications-<bucket-label>`
   * `MasterAccountId: The` 12 digit AWS Account ID where Panther is deployed
   * `PantherRegion:` The region where Panther is deployed
   * `SnsTopicName:` The name of the SNS topic receiving the notification, by default this is `panther-notifications-topic`
6. Click **Next**, **Next**, and then **Create Stack** to complete the process.&#x20;

Note: This stack has one output named `SnsTopicArn`.

### Modify an existing SNS topic

{% hint style="info" %}
If you opted to create a new SNS topic in the previous step, skip this step and proceed to [configure bucket notifications](s3.md#configure-event-notifications-on-the-bucket) below.
{% endhint %}

Follow the steps below if you wish to use an existing topic for sending bucket notifications. Note that the SNS topic must be in the same region as your S3 bucket.

#### Modify SNS Access Policy

Create a subscription between your SNS topic and Panther's log processing SQS queue.

1. Log into the AWS Console for the account where your S3 bucket exists
2. Navigate to the [SNS Console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home#/topics) and select the SNS Topic currently receiving events
3. Note the ARN of this SNS topic
4. Click **Edit** and scroll down to the `Access Policy` card
5. Add the statement shown below to the topic's `Access Policy`. Populate `<PANTHER-MASTER-ACCOUNT-ID>` with the 12-digit account ID where Panther is deployed - navigate to your Settings > General page in your Panther UI to obtain this ID. Populate `SNS-TOPIC-ARN` with the ARN you noted on step #3:

```javascript
{
  "Sid": "CrossAccountSubscription",
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<MasterAccountId>:root"
  },
  "Action": "sns:Subscribe",
  "Resource": "<SNS-TOPIC-ARN>"
}
```

#### Create SNS Subscription

Finally, create the subscription to the Panther Master account's SQS queue.

From the SNS Console, click **Create subscription**:

1. **Protocol**: `Amazon SQS`
2. **Endpoint**: `arn:aws:sqs:<PantherRegion>:<MasterAccountId>:panther-input-data-notifications-queue`
3. Make sure that `Enable raw message delivery` is disabled.&#x20;
4. Click **Create subscription**.

### Configure Event Notifications on the bucket

With the SNS Topic created, the final step is to enable notifications from the S3 buckets.

1. Navigate to the AWS [S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home), select the relevant bucket, and click the **Properties** tab.
2. Locate the Event Notifications card.&#x20;
3. Click **+ Create event notification** and use the following settings:

|   Field   | Value                                                                                    |
| :-------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `Name`  | `PantherEventNotifications`                                                              |
|  `Events` | `All object create events`                                                               |
| `Send to` | `SNS Topic`                                                                              |
|   `SNS`   | `panther-notifications-topic`                                                            |
|  `Suffix` | (optional) limits notifications to objects with keys that end in matching characters     |
|  `Prefix` | (optional) limits notifications to objects with keys that start with matching characters |

4\. Click **Save**.

{% hint style="success" %}
That's it! Everything should be set up correctly and Panther can start processing new files arriving to your bucket.
{% endhint %}
