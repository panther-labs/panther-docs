# Atlassian

## Overview

Panther has the ability to fetch Atlassian event logs by querying the [Atlassian Organizations REST API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/organization/rest/intro/). Panther is specifically monitoring the following Atlassian events:

* Administrative actions, related to settings or other organization pages&#x20;
* Actions that organization admins take related to the organizationâ€™s security policies

In order to set up Atlassian as a log source in Panther, you'll need to authorize Panther in Atlassian by generating an API key in your Atlassian account and then set up Atlassian as a log source in Panther.&#x20;

## How to onboard Atlassian logs to Panther

### Step 1: Generate an API key in Atlassian

1. From your organization at [admin.atlassian.com](http://admin.atlassian.com/), select **Settings** > **API keys**.
2. Click **Create API key** in the top right.
3. Enter a descriptive API key name.
   * By default, the key expires one week after creation.&#x20;
   * To change the expiration date, pick a new date under **Expires on**.&#x20;
   * **Note:** The maximum you can extend your expiration date is up to one year from creation date.
4. Click **Create** to save the API key.
5. Copy the values for your **Organization ID** and **API key**.&#x20;
   * You'll need these values to access your organization in Step 2.
   * Make sure you store these values in a safe place, as Atlassian will not display them again.
6. Click **Done**. The new key will appear in your list of API keys.

**Note:** If you have trouble creating the API key, reference [Atlassian's docs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/organization/rest/intro/).



### Step 2: Create a new Atlassian log source in Panther

1. Log in to your Panther Console.
2. Go to **Integrations** > **Log** **Sources** from the sidebar menu.
3. Click **Create New.**
4. Select **Atlassian** from the list of available log sources, then click **Start Source Setup**.
5. Enter a descriptive name for the source e.g. `My Atlassian Event logs` and then click **Continue Setup.**
6. On the Set Credentials page, fill in the form:&#x20;
   * **Organization**: Enter your Atlassian organization ID that you generated in the previous steps of this documentation.
   * **API Key**: Enter your Atlassian API Key that you generated in the previous steps of this documentation.
7. Click **Continue Setup**.
8. On the confirmation screen, you can optionally set up a log drop-off alarm, which sends an error message if logs aren't received within a specified time interval. When you are finished, click **Finish Setup**.
