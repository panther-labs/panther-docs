# Zoom

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available in versions 1.25 and newer.
{% endhint %}

Panther has the ability to fetch Zoom operational and activity logs by querying various Zoom API endpoints. Panther can specifically monitor the following Zoom events:

* Changes to Account and Group settings
* Changes in role and license assignments for users
* Changes to subscriptions under Billing
* Changes made to SSO configuration, including changes made by your SSO and SAML mapping configuration

To set up this integration, you will create an OAuth2 app in your Zoom account and then configure Zoom as a log source in your Panther Console.&#x20;

### Prerequisites

* To create an OAuth app in Zoom, you need to register the app in the Zoom Marketplace. You can find more details on this process in Zoom's documentation here: [Create an OAuth App](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/build/oauth-app/).&#x20;
* The Zoom user authorizing the integration must have the Admin role and Reports permissions to read [Operations Logs and Sign-in/Sign-out Activity](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201363213-Getting-started-with-Zoom-reporting#h\_01FM5FHPRMBC5RFJDAZ4FBTPKC).

## Create a new Zoom log source in Panther

1. Log in to your Panther Console.
2. In the left sidebar menu, click **Integrations** > **Log** **Sources**.
3. Click **Add Source.**
4. Select **Zoom** from the list of available log sources.
5. In the next screen, enter a friendly name for the source e.g. `My Zoom logs`.&#x20;
6. Click **Continue Setup**.
7. Copy the Redirect URL from Panther and save it in a secure location. You will need this in the next steps when you create an OAuth2 App in Zoom.&#x20;

Before you complete the configuration in the Panther Console, you will need to create the OAuth App in Zoom and obtain your App Client ID and Client Secret.

## Create a new OAuth2 App&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You must be an Admin user in your organization's Zoom account to create the OAuth2 App.
{% endhint %}

1. Log into your Zoom account.
2. Register your app.
   1. Go to the [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/) .
   2. Click **Develop** in the dropdown menu in the top-right corner of the page.&#x20;
   3. Select **Build App**.&#x20;
      * A new page will appear displaying the available app types.&#x20;
   4. Click **Create** in the **OAuth** option to continue.
3. Create an OAuth app with the following parameters:
   * **App Name:** The appâ€™s name.
   * **App Type:** Choose **Account-level app** as the app type.
   * **Distribution:** You can choose **Enabled** to make the app publicly available in the Zoom App Marketplace, or toggle to Disabled to make the app private. The app does not need to be publicly available for this integration.
4. When finished, click **Create**.&#x20;
   * A new window displaying your new OAuth app will appear.
5. When you create your app, be sure to copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your app as you will need this to authenticate Zoom as a log source in the Panther Console.
6. In the **Redirect URL** and **OAuth allow list** fields, paste in the Redirect URL that you copied from the Panther Console in the earlier steps of this documentation.&#x20;
7. Navigate to **Scopes > Add Scopes** and Select **Report** with "View report data" ticked.&#x20;
8. Click **Done**.
9. Navigate back to the Panther Console to complete the setup.

## Finish Setup in Panther

1. In the Panther Console, on the "Set Credentials" page, Enter **Client ID** and the **Client Secret** that you obtained from Zoom.&#x20;
2. Click **Continue Setup**.
   * Panther will verify access to Zoom. If you see an error, review the credentials you provided to Panther.
3. You will be redirected to a confirmation screen where you can set up a log drop-off alarm (this will send an error message if logs aren't received within a specified time interval).

## Panther-Built Detections

The following detections are available for use immediately:&#x20;

* Operation Passcode Disabled
* Operation User Granted Admin
