# Apache

## Overview

Panther supports ingesting Apache logs via common [Data Transport](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports) options: Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 and AWS SQS.

## How to onboard Apache logs to Panther

To pull these logs into Panther:

1. Set up your Data Transport in the Panther Console.
   * Please follow Pantherâ€™s documentation for configuring the Data Transport option you will use:
     * [AWS S3 bucket](../data-transports/s3.md)
     * [AWS SQS](../data-transports/sqs/)
2. Configure your Data Transport source to pull in logs from Apache.
   * See the Data Transport service provider's documentation for instructions on pulling in logs.

## Supported  log types

### Apache.AccessCombined

Apache HTTP server access logs using the `combined` format.
