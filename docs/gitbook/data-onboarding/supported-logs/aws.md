# AWS

## Overview

Panther supports ingesting Amazon Web Services (AWS) logs via common [Data Transport](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports) options: Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 and AWS SQS.

## How to onboard AWS logs to Panther

To pull these logs into Panther, set up an S3 bucket or SQS queue in the Panther Console to stream data from your AWS account. Please follow Pantherâ€™s documentation for configuring S3 or SQS:

* [AWS S3 bucket](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports/s3)
* [AWS SQS](aws.md#aws.s3serveraccess)

#### AWS CloudTrail log latency

The latency between an event occurring in AWS and the event being sent to CloudTrail can be up to 15 minutes, but we commonly see data coming in at an average of 3.5 minutes. For more information, please see Amazon's documentation: [How CloudTrail works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/how-cloudtrail-works.html).

### Cloud Security Scanning for AWS resources

In addition to monitoring AWS logs for active security events, incidents, and breaches, we recommend onboarding your AWS environment as a Cloud Account for [Cloud Security Scanning](../../cloud-scanning/). Cloud Security Scanning scans cloud resources in your AWS account to check for potential vulnerabilities. Panther comes with several built-in policies that will alert you to vulnerabilities in your AWS environment.&#x20;

To learn more about how to set up Cloud Security Scanning for AWS, please see the documentation: [Onboarding Cloud Accounts](../../cloud-scanning/onboarding-cloud-accounts.md).

| `requestProcessingTime`  | `double`    | The total time elapsed (in seconds, with millisecond precision) from the time the load balancer received the request until the time it sent it to a target. This value is set to -1 if the load balancer can't dispatch the request to a target. This can happen if the target closes the connection before the idle timeout or if the client sends a malformed request. This value can also be set to -1 if the registered target does not respond before the idle timeout.                                                                  |
| `targetProcessingTime`   | `double`    | The total time elapsed (in seconds, with millisecond precision) from the time the load balancer sent the request to a target until the target started to send the response headers. This value is set to -1 if the load balancer can't dispatch the request to a target. This can happen if the target closes the connection before the idle timeout or if the client sends a malformed request. This value can also be set to -1 if the registered target does not respond before the idle timeout.                                          |
| `responseProcessingTime` | `double`    | The total time elapsed (in seconds, with millisecond precision) from the time the load balancer received the response header from the target until it started to send the response to the client. This includes both the queuing time at the load balancer and the connection acquisition time from the load balancer to the client. This value is set to -1 if the load balancer can't send the request to a target. This can happen if the target closes the connection before the idle timeout or if the client sends a malformed request. |
| **`elbStatusCode`**      | `bigint`    | The status code of the response from the load balancer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `targetStatusCode`       | `bigint`    | The status code of the response from the target. This value is recorded only if a connection was established to the target and the target sent a response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `receivedBytes`          | `bigint`    | The size of the request, in bytes, received from the client (requester). For HTTP requests, this includes the headers. For WebSockets, this is the total number of bytes received from the client on the connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### AWS.CloudWatchEvents

Amazon CloudWatch Events describe a change in Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources. Reference: [Amazon CloudWatch Events and Patterns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/CloudWatchEventsandEventPatterns.html).

| Column                   | Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`id`**                 | `string`    | A unique value is generated for every event. This can be helpful in tracing events as they move through rules to targets, and are processed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **`account`**            | `string`    | The 12-digit number identifying an AWS account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **`source`**             | `string`    | Identifies the service that sourced the event. All events sourced from within AWS begin with 'aws'. Customer-generated events can have any value here, as long as it doesn't begin with 'aws'. We recommend the use of Java package-name style reverse domain-name strings.                                                                                                      |
| **`resources`**          | `[string]`  | This JSON array contains ARNs that identify resources that are involved in the event. Inclusion of these ARNs is at the discretion of the service. For example, Amazon EC2 instance state-changes include Amazon EC2 instance ARNs, Auto Scaling events include ARNs for both instances and Auto Scaling groups, but API calls with AWS CloudTrail do not include resource ARNs. |
| **`region`**             | `string`    | Identifies the AWS region where the event originated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **`detail-type`**        | `string`    | Identifies, in combination with the source field, the fields and values that appear in the detail field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **`version`**            | `string`    | By default, this is set to 0 (zero) in all events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **`time`**               | `timestamp` | The event timestamp, which can be specified by the service originating the event. If the event spans a time interval, the service might choose to report the start time, so this value can be noticeably before the time the event is actually received.                                                                                                                         |
| **`detail`**             | `string`    | A JSON object, whose content is at the discretion of the service originating the event. The detail content in the example above is very simple, just two fields. AWS API call events have detail objects with around 50 fields nested several levels deep.                                                                                                                       |

A terminating rule has an action that ends the inspection process against a web request. Possible actions for a terminating rule are ALLOW and BLOCK. This is only populated for SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) match rule statements. As with all rule statements that inspect for more than one thing, AWS WAF applies the action on the first match and stops inspecting the web request. A web request with a terminating action could contain other threats, in addition to the one reported in the log. |
