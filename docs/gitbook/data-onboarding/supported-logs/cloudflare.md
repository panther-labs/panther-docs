# Cloudflare

## Overview

Panther supports ingesting Cloudfare logs via common [Data Transport](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports) options: Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 and SQS.

## How to onboard Cloudfare logs to Panther

To connect these logs into Panther:

1. Set up your Data Transport in the Panther Console.
   * Please follow Pantherâ€™s documentation for configuring the Data Transport option you will use:
     * [AWS S3 bucket](../data-transports/s3.md)
     * [AWS SQS](../data-transports/sqs/)
2. Configure Cloudflare to push logs to the Data Transport source.
   * See Cloudflare's documentation for instructions on pushing logs to your selected Data Transport source.
