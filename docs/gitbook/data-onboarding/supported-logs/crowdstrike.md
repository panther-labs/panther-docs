| **`Time`**            | `timestamp` | Timestamp of when the event was received by the CrowdStrike cloud. This is not to be confused with the time the event was generated locally on the system (the \_timeevent). This is the timestamp of the event from the cloud's point of view. This value can be converted to any time format and can be used for calculations. |
| **`AgentLoadFlags`**  | `int`       | Whether the sensor loaded during or after the Windows host's boot process. Example values: 0, 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Crowdstrike.UserIdentity

The UserIdentity event is generated when a user logs in to a host. It conveys important security-related characteristics associated with a user to the CrowdStrike cloud, such as the user name. Itâ€™s normally generated once per security principal, and is thus not on its own a sign of a suspicious activity. Available for Mac & Windows platforms.
