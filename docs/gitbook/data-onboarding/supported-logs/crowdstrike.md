# CrowdStrike Logs

## Overview

Panther supports pulling logs directly from CrowdStrike events by integrating with the [CrowdStrike Falcon Data Replicator](https://developer.crowdstrike.com/crowdstrike/docs/falcon-data-replicator-guide).

## How to onboard CrowdStrike logs to Panther

### Prerequisites

* You must have an active subscription to [Falcon Data Replicator](https://developer.crowdstrike.com/crowdstrike/docs/falcon-data-replicator-guide#section-overview-of-falcon-data-replicator) and it must be enabled in Crowdstrike.
* There is no minimum version of Falcon Data Replicator required.

### Step 1: Create FDR API Keys

1. Log in to your CrowdStrike Falcon console.
2. Navigate to the **API Clients and Keys** page.
3. Click **Create new credentials** under the **FDR AWS S3 Credentials and SQS Queue** section.
4. Copy down the Client ID, Secret ID, and SQS URL for the next steps.

### Step 2: Create a New CrowdStrike Source in Panther

1. Log in to your Panther Console.
2. In the left sidebar menu, click **Integrations** > **Log** **Sources**.
3. Click **Create New.**
4. Select **CrowdStrike** from the list of available log sources. Click **Start Source Setup**.
5. Fill in the fields below:
   * **Name**: A memorable name for the source e.g. `CrowdStrike Falcon`.
   * **SQS Url**: The URL for the CrowdStrike-managed SQS queue, previously copied.
   * **AWS Access Key**, **AWS Access Secret**: The AWS access key and secret, previously copied.\
     \
     ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (24) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)\

6. Click **Continue Setup.**
7. You will be directed to a confirmation screen where you can set up a log drop-off alarm.
   * This feature sends an error message if logs aren't received within a specified time interval.
8. Click **Finish Setup**.

## Supported log types

### Crowdstrike.ProcessRollup2Stats

When a process finishes running, the sensor generates and sends a ProcessRollup2 event. Mac and Linux sensors send far more ProcessRollup2 events than Windows (roughly 20x as many), so rather than send events for every process on those hosts, the sensor sends an initial ProcessRollup2 event, followed 10 minutes later by a ProcessRollup2Stats event with a SHA256 hash and the count of how many times the hash executed in the last 10 minutes.

### Crowdstrike.UserIdentity

The UserIdentity event is generated when a user logs in to a host. It conveys important security-related characteristics associated with a user to the CrowdStrike cloud, such as the user name. Itâ€™s normally generated once per security principal, and is thus not on its own a sign of a suspicious activity. Available for Mac & Windows platforms.
