# Duo

## Overview

Panther can collect the following Duo logs via the [Duo API](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#logs):

* [Authentication Logs (v2)](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#authentication-logs)
* [Administrator Logs](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#administrator-logs)
* [Telephony Logs](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#telephony-logs)
* [Offline Enrollment Logs](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#offline-enrollment-logs)

In order for Panther to access the Duo API you need to create a new 'Duo App' and provide the app credentials to Panther.

## How to onboard Duo logs to Panther

### Create a Duo application

1.  Follow the instructions [here](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#first-steps) to create a new Duo application.

    Note that only administrators with the Owner role can create or modify an Admin API application in the Duo Admin Panel.
2. Make sure to grant the application **Grant read log** permissions.

### Create a new Duo source in Panther

1. Log in to your Panther Console.
2. In the left sidebar menu, click **Integrations** > **Log** **Sources**.
3. Click **Create New.**
4. Select **Duo** from the list of available log sources. Click **Start Source Setup**.
5. On the next screen, enter a memorable name for the source e.g., `My Duo logs` and select the type of logs you want to monitor.
6. Click **Continue Setup.**
7. Fill in the fields below:
   * **Integration Key**: The integration key of the Duo app.
   * **Secret Key**: The secret key of the Duo app.
   * **API Hostname**: The API hostname of the Duo app.
8. Click **Continue Setup.**
9. You will be directed to a confirmation screen where you can set up a log drop-off alarm.
   * This feature sends an error message if logs aren't received within a specified time interval.
10. Click **Finish Setup**.
