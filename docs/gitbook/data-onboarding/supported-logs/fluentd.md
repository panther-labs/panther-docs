# Fluentd

## Overview

Panther supports ingesting Fluentd logs via common [Data Transport](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports) options: Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 and SQS.

## How to onboard Fluentd logs to Panther

To connect these logs into Panther:

1. Set up your Data Transport in the Panther Console.
   * Please follow Pantherâ€™s documentation for configuring the Data Transport option you will use:
     * [AWS S3 bucket](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports/s3)
     * [AWS SQS](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports/sqs)
2. Configure Fluentd to push logs to the Data Transport source.
   * See Fluentd's documentation for instructions on pushing logs to your selected Data Transport source.
