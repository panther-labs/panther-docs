# JAMF Pro Logs

## Overview

Panther supports ingesting JAMF Pro logs via Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 as a [Data Transport](../data-transports/).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** A [JAMF Premium Cloud add-on](https://resources.jamf.com/documents/products/documentation/jamf-premium-cloud.pdf) is required to connect JAMF Pro logs to Panther.
{% endhint %}

## How to onboard JAMF Pro logs to Panther

To connect these logs into Panther:

1. Set up your Data Transport in the Panther Console.
   * Please follow Pantherâ€™s documentation for configuring the Data Transport option via an [AWS S3 bucket](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports/s3).
2. Configure JAMF Pro to push logs to the Data Transport source.
   * See JAMF's documentation for instructions on pushing logs to your selected Data Transport source.
