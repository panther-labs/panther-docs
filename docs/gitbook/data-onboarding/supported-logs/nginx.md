# Nginx

## Overview&#x20;

Panther supports ingesting Nginx logs via common [Data Transport](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports) options: Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3, SQS, and CloudWatch.

## How to onboard Nginx logs to Panther

To connect these logs into Panther:

1. Set up your Data Transport in the Panther Console.
   * Please follow Pantherâ€™s documentation for configuring the Data Transport option you will use:
     * [AWS S3 bucket](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports/s3)
     * [AWS SQS](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports/sqs)
     * [AWS CloudWatch](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports/cwl-source)
2. Configure Nginx to push logs to the Data Transport source.
   * See Nginx's documentation for instructions on pushing logs to your selected Data Transport source.
