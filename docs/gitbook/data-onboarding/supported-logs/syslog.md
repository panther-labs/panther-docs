# Syslog Logs

## Overview

Panther supports ingesting Syslog logs via common [Data Transport](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports) options: Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3, SQS, and CloudWatch.

## How to onboard Syslog logs to Panther

To connect these logs into Panther:

1. Set up your Data Transport in the Panther Console.
   * Please follow Pantherâ€™s documentation for configuring the Data Transport option you will use:
     * [AWS S3 bucket](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports/s3)
     * [AWS SQS](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports/sqs)
     * [AWS CloudWatch](https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/data-transports/cwl-source)
2. Configure Syslog to push logs to the Data Transport source.
   * See Syslog documentation for instructions on pushing logs to your selected Data Transport source.

### Syslog.RFC3164

| Column                | Type        | Description                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`priority`**        | `smallint`  | Priority is calculated by (Facility \* 8 + Severity). The lower this value, the higher importance of the log message.            |
| **`facility`**        | `smallint`  | Facility value helps determine which process created the message. Eg: 0 = kernel messages, 3 = system daemons.                   |
| **`severity`**        | `smallint`  | Severity indicates how severe the message is. Eg: 0=Emergency to 7=Debug.                                                        |
| `timestamp`           | `timestamp` | Timestamp of the syslog message in UTC.                                                                                          |

| `procid`              | `string`    | ProcID is often the process ID, but can be any value used to enable log analyzers to detect discontinuities in syslog reporting. |
| `msgid`               | `string`    | MsgID identifies the type of message. For example, a firewall might use the MsgID 'TCPIN' for incoming TCP traffic.              |

| `p_any_domain_names`  | `[string]`  | Panther added field with collection of domain names associated with the row                                                      |
