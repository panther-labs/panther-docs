# Asana

This page will walk you through configuring [Asana](https://asana.com) as a destination for your Panther alerts.

The Asana destination requires an `Access Token` and one or more `Project GID`. When an alert is forwarded to an Asana destination, a new task is created in the configured Asana project(s).

### Configuring Asana

1. Determine which Asana user you will use to be the reporter of issues.
   * To ensure continuity, we recommend creating a service account specifically for this purpose.
2. Copy your Asana project's **Project GID**. You will need this in the next steps. To find the Project GID:
   1. In Asana, click **Home** in the left sidebar.
   2. Scroll down to the Projects section. Hover over the project you want to use, then click **â€¦** on the right side of the project name.\

   3. In the dropdown menu that appears, click **Copy project link:**\

   4. The copied link should look like `https://app.asana.com/0/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/board`. The `Project GID` is the 16-digit number in the URL.
3. Copy your Asana user's **Access Token**. To find the Access Token:
   1. Log in as the user who is the designated reporter of issues.
   2. Go to [https://app.asana.com/0/developer-console](https://app.asana.com/0/developer-console).
   3. Click **+New Access Token**.\

   4. After you create the token, copy it and store it in a secure location.&#x20;
      * Note: This token should be treated as sensitively as a password, and you will not be able to access it again in the future.



### Setting up the Destination in Panther

1. Log in to your Panther Console and navigate to **Integrations > Alert Destinations**.&#x20;
2. Click **+Add your first Destination**.
   * If you have already created Destinations, click **+** in the upper right side of the page to add a new Destination.
3. Click **Asana** from the list of options.
4.  Fill in the form to configure the Asana Destination.

    * **Display Name**: Enter a descriptive name.
    * **Access Token**: Paste in the Access Token you created for your user in Asana.
    * **Project GIDs**: Paste in your Asana project(s) GID then hit the `Return` key.
    * Adjust the **Severity** and **Default Alert Types**.
