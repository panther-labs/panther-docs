# Architecture

Panther is a collection of serverless applications deployed on an AWS instance managed by Panther. The frontend is a React application which runs in a Docker container (via ECS), and the backend is a collection of compute (Lambda), storage (DynamoDB / S3), and other supporting services.

The sections below cover how Panther works under the hood: an architectural overview and how your data is stored/processed.

## Architecture Diagram

This diagram provides an overview of the core components of Panther, and how they are connected.

### Data Flow Diagram

This diagram shows where and how your data is stored and processed:

The above arrows indicate the direction in which data is transferred, as opposed to the previous diagrams where arrows are indicating the direction that communication is being initiated.
