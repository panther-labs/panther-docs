# Enrichment (BETA)

It is increasingly difficult for security teams to separate signal from noise, due to the exponential increase in security-relevant data generated by cloud infrastructure, and the alarming pace with which attackers can evolve their tools, techniques and processes. Excessive alerts and false positives are often ranked as the most significant challenges customers face with SIEM platforms. This is concerning given that the SIEM platform is often the foundational tool used by security teams to identify and triage alerts.

{% hint style="info" %}
Panther's Enrichment capabilities allow security teams to cut through background noise, improve alert fidelity, speed up analyst workflows and ensure prioritization of the most critical alerts. By making detection and response faster and more accurate, security teams can better protect their organizations from disruptive cyberattacks.

## Additional Features Coming Soon

We are working hard to add to Panther's native enrichment capabilities. We will soon be adding ways to:

1. Enrich IP addresses with geolocation details with native geo IP lookup data (IPInfo)
2. Auto configure common use cases for lookup based enrichment (1Password UID or Crowdstrike AID to user names/emails)
