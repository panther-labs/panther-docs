## Additional Features Coming Soon

We are working hard to add to Panther's native enrichment capabilities. We will soon be adding ways to:

1. Enrich IP addresses with geolocation details with native geo IP lookup data (IPInfo)
2. Auto configure common use cases for lookup based enrichment (1Password UID or Crowdstrike AID to user names/emails)
