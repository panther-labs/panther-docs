# Using Lookup Tables: 1Password UUIDs

By default, 1Password logs do not contain human readable values for objects such as vaults and login credentials. Instead, each object is referenced by a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID). You can use [Lookup Tables](https://docs.runpanther.io/data-analytics/lookup-tables) in Panther to translate the UUIDs to friendly names. We recommend using Command Line Interface (CLI), but it is also possible to use the API.

{% hint style="info" %}
For more information on Lookup Tables, please see Panther's documentation: [Lookup Tables (BETA)](https://docs.runpanther.io/data-analytics/lookup-tables)
{% endhint %}

In the following example, we extracted a list of 1Password items and their associated UUIDs via CLI, then created a Lookup Table to translate the UUIDs into their human-readable friendly names.&#x20;

**Prerequisites**:

* An existing 1Password log source with data being ingested to your Panther account&#x20;
* The Command Line utility jq installed
* The [1Password command-line tool](https://1password.com/downloads/command-line/) is installed



**Obtaining a list of 1Password items with their associated UUIDs**

1. Log in to 1Password via CLI.
2.  Use the following function to extract a list of 1Password items including their associated UUIDs and save it to a JSON file called _1password\_lookup.json_:\
    &#x20;`op item list --format json | jq -c '.[] | {uuid:.id,title:.title,updatedAt:.updatedat}' >> 1passwordlookup.json`

    \
    Or, if you're using the 1Password CLI v1, use the following command:

    * `op list items | jq -c '.[] | {uuid:.uuid,title:.overview.title,updatedAt:.updatedAt}' >> 1password_lookup.json`

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that you will need to create a schema using this 1password\_lookup.json in a later step.

For more information on creating a schema, see [Generating a Schema for a Custom Log Type from Sample Logs](../data-onboarding/custom-log-types/#generating-a-schema-for-a-custom-log-type-from-sample-logs)

**Creating a Lookup Table in Panther**

1. Log in to your Panther Console. In the left-hand navigation, click **Enrichment > Lookup Tables**.
2. In the upper right, click **+** to create a new Lookup Table.
3. On the Lookup Table Basic Information page, add a Lookup Name, and optionally a description and reference. \
   ![](../.gitbook/assets/1pw-lookup-table-basic-info.jpg)
   * In this example, the Lookup Name is “1Password Translation” and the Description is “Translates 1Password UUIDs to human readable names.”&#x20;
   * The Reference field is generally used to store a hyperlink to a related internal resource.
4. Click **Continue**.&#x20;
5. On the Associated Log Types page, select the Log Type **OnePassword.ItemUsage**. Under Selectors, add `item_uuid`. \
   &#x20;![](../.gitbook/assets/1pw-log-type.png)
6. Click **Continue**.&#x20;
7. On the Table Schema page, add the schema you created based on your 1Password JSON file. For the Primary Key Name, select `uuid`.&#x20;
   * If you have not created a schema yet, please follow the documentation here to create one before moving on to the next step: [Generating a Schema for a Custom Log Type from Sample Logs](https://docs.runpanther.io/data-onboarding/custom-log-types#generating-a-custom-log-type-from-sample-logs).
8. Click **Continue**.&#x20;
9. On the Import Data page, click **Select file** then select the OnePasswordItems JSON file.&#x20;
10. Click **Finish Setup** to go back to the list of Lookup Tables.

Now that you've created a Lookup Table, you can write detections based on the additional context from your Lookup Table. We will cover writing detections using these new values in the following sections.



**Obtaining data for a detection**&#x20;

1. Log in to your Panther account, and in the left-side navigation, click **Data Explorer**.&#x20;
2. Write a new query to extract the first 10 lines of your OnePassword items: `select * from your_company_logs.public.onepassword_itemusage limit 10`
3. In the "Results" table at the bottom of the page, click **View JSON** next to one of the records.&#x20;
4. Copy the JSON text to your clipboard.



In the example below, we are writing a detection based on the name given to a specific set of login credentials from a 1Password vault. In this case, the login name in 1Password is labeled “Sensitive Password.”



**Writing a Detection**

1. In the left-side navigation of your Panther account, click **Detections**.&#x20;
2. On the Detections page, click **+** in the upper right to create a new Detection.&#x20;
3. At the top of the page, click **Rule**.&#x20;
4. In the Log Type field, choose "OnePasswordItems."
5. Under “Functions & Tests”, click **Create Test**. Paste in the JSON text you copied from Data Explorer.&#x20;
6. Click **Enrich Test Data** and verify that the title is listed as a friendly name under the `p.enrichment` field:\
   ![](../.gitbook/assets/1pw-login-title-encrichment.png)
7.  In the text box labeled “Rule Function”, paste in the following:\
    `from panther_base_helpers import deep_get`

    `def rule(event):` \
    &#x20;   `if deep_get(event, "p_enrichment", "1Password Translation","item_uuid", "title") == "Sensitive Password":` \
    &#x20;   `return True`
8. [Run tests](https://docs.runpanther.io/writing-detections/testing) on your new detection. When you are finished testing, click **Save** in the upper right side of the page.
