# Self-Hosted Deployments (Legacy)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Panther does not support self-hosted deployments for new accounts. Only SaaS deployments are supported for new customers.
{% endhint %}

The following is legacy documentation.

### Upgrades

When Panther publishes a new release, we will notify our self-hosted customers so that they can coordinate upgrades on their schedule. Upgrades should generally be straightforward, but there are a few steps to follow before and during upgrades to make sure everything goes smoothly.

#### Before you upgrade

Before you begin an upgrade, make sure you know what version of Panther to upgrade to. We use semantic versioning, and highly recommend not skipping minor releases. So if for example, you're on version `1.10.X`  and want to upgrade to version `1.13.X`, we recommend first upgrading to the highest patch version of `1.11.X`, then `1.12.X`, and then finally `1.13.X`. This ensures there are no migration issues.

Additionally, if you are using our `PantherDeploymentRole` to deploy Panther, make sure you update the `PantherDeploymentRole` to the correct version for the version of Panther you are deploying. If you are on version `1.13.X` and wish to upgrade to version  `1.14.X`,  make sure the `PantherDeploymentRole`  is also on version `1.14.X` before upgrading. Here is the `PantherDeploymentRole` template URL:

```
https://panther-public-cloudformation-templates.s3.amazonaws.com/panther-deployment-role/{version}/template.yml
```

#### While you upgrade

In order to perform the upgrade, simply find the root Panther stack in the CloudFormation console, click the `Update` button, select `Replace template URL`, and insert the `TemplateURL` for the desired version of Panther you wish to deploy. The template URL should be in this format:

**Example**

****[https://panther-enterprise-us-east-2.s3.amazonaws.com/v1.25.1/panther.yml](https://panther-enterprise-{region}.s3.amazonaws.com/%7Bversion%7D/panther.yml)

```
https://panther-enterprise-{region}.s3.amazonaws.com/{version}/panther.yml
```

You will be prompted to click through a few pages verifying your CloudFormation parameters are correct and that CloudFormation can create IAM resources and nested CloudFormation resources on your behalf.

#### Trigger Pulumi CodeBuild

We are migrating to Pulumi for infrastructure management - after the main Panther stack is deployed, you'll need to start a build for the `panther-pulumi` CodeBuild project. \
\
For example: `aws codebuild start-build --project-name panther-pulumi`

#### Available versions of Panther

We recommend not skipping minor versions of Panther while upgrading, but upgrading to the most recent patch version instead. Here are the most recent patch versions of Panther that we recommend upgrading to:

* `v1.39.7`
* `v1.38.5`
* `v1.37.11`
* `v1.36.0`
* `v1.35.7`
* `v1.34.18`
* `v1.33.5`
* `v1.32.7`
* `v1.31.1`
* `v1.30.5`
* `v1.29.3`
* `v1.28.7`
* `v1.27.8`
* `v1.26.9`
* `v1.25.18`
* `v1.24.12`
* `v1.23.5`

### Reference

#### Naming the root stack

When deploying Panther, you will be provided with a template URL to a root panther stack to deploy. If you're using the `PantherDeploymentRole` to deploy Panther, be sure to name the root stack something with a `panther-` prefix. The name of the root stack will be pre-pended to any resources created by the stack, and the `PantherDeploymentRole` limits its access in part by restricting its permissions to only affect resources that start with the name `panther-`.

#### Configuring deployment parameters

The Panther CloudFormation stack has a number of configurable deployment parameters. Pay special attention to the following options:

* `FirstUserEmail` _**(required)**_: a Panther admin invite will be sent to this email address. Updates to this value are ignored after the first successful deploy.
* `PulumiSecretArn` and `PulumiSecretKeyArn` **(**_**required**_**):** these values will be provided by our team - you will have a dedicated [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) access token in our organization.
* `OnboardSelf`: whether you want Panther to onboard its own AWS account for monitoring.
* `SentryEnvironment`: by default, application errors are sent to [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for us to triage. We strongly recommend keeping this enabled with the default value (`prod`), but if that's not an option for you, you can disable the Sentry integration by setting this to a blank string.
* `SupportRoleIdentityAccountId`: by default, a read-only SupportRole is deployed with Panther which our on-call engineers can assume to triage application errors. This role does **not** have access to your data and weâ€™d encourage you to keep it enabled so we can deliver a better support experience. However, if you prefer, this role can be disabled by setting the `SupportRoleIdentityAccountId` to a blank string.
* `OpsRoleIdentityAccountId`: a non-empty value will deploy an OperationsRole with service-level admin permissions for migrations, data recoveries, and other operational emergencies. We recommend keeping this role disabled until necessary (it's off by default).
* `DataLakeForwarderMemory`: Memory to use for Cloud Security DataLake Forwarder lambdas. The default setting is 256, with a maximum value of 2048 and a minimum value of 256.
* `MaxLookupTableCompressedSizeMB`: The maximum size (in MB) of the Gzip-compressed data backing a Lookup Table. The default setting is 200, with a maximum value of 400.

Panther has a number of other configuration options besides the ones listed above. We recommend not setting any of these parameters on the first deployment of Panther. If any step of the initial deployment fails, the entire deployment will fail and rollback deleting all infrastructure. After you complete the initial deployment of Panther, you can update the stack with different root parameters. Then if any of these settings cause a deployment failure, Panther will simply roll back to the previous settings without needing an entire fresh deployment. This includes parameters like the snowflake and custom domain configuration parameters.
