# AWS CloudTrail Logs S3 Bucket Not Publicly Accessible

| Risk | Remediation Effort |
| :--- | :--- |
| **High** | **Medium** |

This policy validates that CloudTrail S3 buckets are not publicly accessible.

CloudTrail logs include detailed events of API activity in your AWS account. It is a security best practice to tightly control who has access to these logs, and making them publicly accessible could lead to accidental exposure of details about your environment.

**Remediation**

To remediate this, modify the associated S3 Bucket to not be publicly accessible.

| Using the AWS Console |
| :--- |
| 1. Access the [AWS S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home#). |
| 2. Select the S3 bucket that you want to make not publicly accessible. |
| 3. Select the "Permissions" tab. |
| 4. Select the "Access Control List" tab. |
| 5. Under the "Public access" header, select each row and in the popup menu uncheck all check boxes and then select the "Save" button. |
| 6. Note that if you were relying on the public access to review these logs, a new more restricted access control list will need to be created. |

| Using the AWS CLI |
| :--- |
| 1. Run the following command to ignore ACL's that grant public access on the given bucket: |
| `aws s3api put-public-access-block --bucket <bucket_name> --public-access-block-configuration "{\"IgnorePublicAcls\": true}"` |
| 2. The AWS CLI command put-public-access-block has several parameters that can be set depending on how you intend to block public access. See the [AWS user documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html) for additional details. |
