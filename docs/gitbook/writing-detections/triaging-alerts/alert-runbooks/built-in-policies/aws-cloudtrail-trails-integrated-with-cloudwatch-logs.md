# AWS CloudTrail Sending To CloudWatch Logs

| Risk | Remediation Effort |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Info** | **Medium** |

This policy validates that all CloudTrails have output being sent CloudWatch for real time analysis.

Real time log analysis is an important part of a mature security posture, and integrating with CloudWatch Logs is one way to accomplish this with AWS.

**Remediation**

To remediate this, configure each AWS CloudTrail trail identified in the report to send its logs to CloudWatch logs.

| Using the AWS Console |
| :--- |
| 1. Navigate to the [AWS CloudTrail Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/home#/configuration). |
| 2. Select the trail you wish to enable CloudWatch logging for. |
| 3. Under the "CloudWatch Logs" header, select the "Configure" button. |
| 4. Specify the name of an existing CloudWatch Logs log group or a name for a new group then select the "Continue" button. |
| 5. Review the role and policy summary, then select the "Allow" button. |

| Using the AWS CLI |
| :--- |
| 1. To integrate AWS CloudTrail with AWS CloudWatch Logs, run the following command: |
| `aws cloudtrail update-trail --name <trail_name> --cloudwatch-logs-log-grouparn <cloudtrail_log_group_arn> --cloudwatch-logs-role-arn <cloudtrail_cloudwatch_logs_role_arn>` |
