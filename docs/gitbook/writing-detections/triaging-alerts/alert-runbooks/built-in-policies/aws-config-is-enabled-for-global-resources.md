# AWS Config Is Enabled for Global Resources

| Risk | Remediation Effort |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Low** | **Low** |

This policy validates that at least one AWS Config recorder is configured to record changes to global resources, such as IAM entities.

**Remediation**

To remediate this, enable global resources for at least one active AWS Config recorder in the account.
