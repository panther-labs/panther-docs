# AWS EC2 Instance Has Detailed Monitoring Enabled

| Risk | Remediation Effort |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Low** | **Low** |

This policy validates that each EC2 Instance is running with detailed monitoring enabled. Detailed monitoring makes instance data available in 1 minute periods, as opposed to 5 minute periods for the Basic monitoring provided by default.

**Remediation**

To remediate this, enable detailed monitoring for each EC2 Instance.
