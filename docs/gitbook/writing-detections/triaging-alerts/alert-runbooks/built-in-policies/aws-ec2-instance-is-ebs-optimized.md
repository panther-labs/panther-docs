# AWS EC2 Instance Is EBS Optimized

| Risk | Remediation Effort |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Low** | **Low** |

This policy validates that each EC2 Instance has EBS optimization enabled, if applicable. EBS optimization provides additional dedicated capacity for Amazon Elastic Block Store \(EBS\) I/O.

**Remediation**

To remediate this, enable EBS optimization for each EC2 Instance.
