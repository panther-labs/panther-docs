# AWS IAM Group Has Users

| Risk | Remediation Effort |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Low** | **Low** |

This policy validates that every IAM Group has at least one IAM user in it. Unused groups increase management complexity and attack surface, and should be deleted.

**Remediation**

To remediate this, delete any IAM groups that do not have any users in them. Alternatively, add appropriate users to the groups.
