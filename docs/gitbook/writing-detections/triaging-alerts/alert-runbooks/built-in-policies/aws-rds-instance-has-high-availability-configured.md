# AWS RDS Instance Has High Availability Configured

| Risk | Remediation Effort |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Low** | **Low** |

This policy validates that all RDS Instances have high availability configured. High availability can prevent the loss of service in the case of regional outages.

**Remediation**

To remediate this, enable and configure the `MutliAZ` setting for all RDS Instances
