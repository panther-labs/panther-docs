# AWS RDS Instance Is Not Publicly Accessible

| Risk | Remediation Effort |
| :--- | :--- |
| **High** | **Low** |

This policy validates that each RDS Instance is not publicly accessible. A publicly accessible RDS Instance is far more vulnerable to remote attacks.

**Remediation**

To remediate this, disable public access for all RDS Instances.
