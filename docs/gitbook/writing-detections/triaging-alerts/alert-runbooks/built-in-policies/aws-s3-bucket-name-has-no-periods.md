# AWS S3 Bucket Name Has No Periods

| Risk | Remediation Effort |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Info** | **Medium** |

This policy validates that no S3 buckets have periods `.` in their name. This is a recommended best practice from AWS, that ensures that the buckets will be able to take advantage of some more advanced features of S3 that require DNS compliant names.

**Remediation**

To remediate this, create new S3 buckets with compliant names and move the contents of the non-compliant bucket into the compliant bucket. Then delete the non-compliant bucket.
