# AWS S3 Bucket Not Publicly Readable

| Risk | Remediation Effort |
| :--- | :--- |
| **High** | **Low** |

This policy validates that no S3 buckets are publicly readable. Overly permissive S3 buckets are a major cause of data loss in AWS. Be extremely careful when making buckets publicly available.

**Remediation**

To remediate this, modify the access policy of the S3 bucket to remove `AllUsers` and `AuthenticatedUsers` from any grant that gives read permissions.
