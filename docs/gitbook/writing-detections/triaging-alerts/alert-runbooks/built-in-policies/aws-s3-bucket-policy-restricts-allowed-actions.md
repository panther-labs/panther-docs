# AWS S3 Bucket Policy Restricts Allowed Actions

| Risk | Remediation Effort |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Medium** | **Low** |

This policy validates that S3 Bucket access policies do not allow any action on the bucket, in accordance with the principle of least privilege.

**Remediation**

To remediate this, modify any grants in the S3 Bucket access policy that have `Effect:Allow` on `Actions:*` or `Actions:s3:*`. New, more restrictive grants may be needed in their place to maintain access.
