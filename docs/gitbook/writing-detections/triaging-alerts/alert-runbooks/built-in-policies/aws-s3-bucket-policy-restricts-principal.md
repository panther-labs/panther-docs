# AWS S3 Bucket Policy Restricts Principal

| Risk | Remediation Effort |
| :--- | :--- |
| **High** | **Low** |

This policy validates that S3 Bucket access policies do not allow any principal for a given action on the bucket, in accordance with the principle of least privilege.

**Remediation**

To remediate this, modify any grants in the S3 Bucket access policy that have `Effect:Allow` on `Princiapl:*`. New, more restrictive grants may be needed in their place to maintain access.
