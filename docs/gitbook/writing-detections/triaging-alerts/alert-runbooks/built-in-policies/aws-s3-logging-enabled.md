# AWS S3 Bucket Has Logging Enabled

| Risk | Remediation Effort |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Low** | **Low** |

This policy validates that all S3 Buckets have access logging enabled. Access logging creates a record of who is accessing what within a given bucket, an important audit trail during investigations.

**Remediation**

To remediate this, enable S3 bucket access logging for each S3 bucket.
