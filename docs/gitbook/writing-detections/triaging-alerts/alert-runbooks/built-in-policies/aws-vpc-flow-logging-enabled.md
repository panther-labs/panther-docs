# AWS VPC Flow Logging Enabled

This policy validates that AWS VPCs \(Virtual Private Clouds\) have network flow logging enabled.

| Risk | Remediation Effort |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Medium** | **Low** |

Flow logs provide layer 3 network traffic telemetry to-and-from any resource within a VPC. This is considered a security best practice as it allows for the monitoring and detection of potentially malicious traffic.

Flow logs can be configured either on a single network interface, a subnet, or an entire VPC. Filters can also be used to limit the logs based on attributes, which in a busy production network is often necessary. Logs can be stored in either CloudWatch Logs or S3.

**Remediation**

Enable Flow Logging for the VPC failing this policy.

| Using the AWS Console |
| :--- |
| 1. Navigate to the "Your VPCs" tab on the [VPC Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home#vpc). |
| 2. Select the VPC where flow logging is not enabled. |
| 3. Select the Flow Logs tab. |
| 4. Select the "Create flow log" button. |
| 5. Set the filter to "Accept", "Reject", or "All" depending on the level of logging desired. |
| 6. Set the destination log group to "default-vpc-flow-logs". |
| 7. Select the IAM role to use for publishing flow logs \(or create one with the Set Up Permissions link on the bottom\). |
| 6. Select the "Create" button. |

| Using the AWS CLI |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. To deliver Flow Logs to a CloudWatch Log Group, run the following command: |  |  |
| \`aws ec2 create-flow-logs --traffic-type &lt;ACCEPT | REJECT | ALL&gt; --resource-type VPC --resource-ids  --log-destination-type cloud-watch-logs --log-group-name "default-vpc-flow-logs" --deliver-logs-permission-arn \` |
| 2. Alternatively, to deliver Flow Logs to an S3 bucket, run the following command: |  |  |
| \`aws ec2 create-flow-logs --traffic-type &lt;ACCEPT | REJECT | ALL&gt; --resource-type VPC --resource-ids  --log-destination-type s3 --log-destination \` |

## Impact

Enabling flow logging will generate additional CloudWatch events, which have an associated cost. There will be no impact to VPC usability or performance.

| Aspect | Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| AWS Cost | Dependent on scope, see the [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing#Example_4_-_Monitoring_VPC_flow_logs) for details |
| VPC Performance | None |
| VPC Usability | None |
