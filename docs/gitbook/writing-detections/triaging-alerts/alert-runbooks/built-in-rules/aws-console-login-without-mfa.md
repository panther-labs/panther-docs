This rule monitors for failed AWS console logins without the use of MFA.

| **Medium** | **Low** |

MFA adds an additional layer of security above passwords to user logins. Best practice is to require MFA for all user logins, and this rule can serve as a supplement to such configurations to ensure they are not accidentally or intentionally subverted.

**Remediation**

Investigate why this user was able to authenticate without MFA. Enable MFA for the user, and modify permissions to ensure further logins without MFA cannot happen.
