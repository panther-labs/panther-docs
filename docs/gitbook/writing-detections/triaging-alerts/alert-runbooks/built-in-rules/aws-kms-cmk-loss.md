# AWS KMS CMK Loss

This rule monitors for activity that could lead to the loss of KMS Customer Managed Keys \(CMKs\).

| Risk | Remediation Effort |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Low** | **Low** |

KMS CMKs cannot be directly deleted by users, but are instead scheduled for deletion at some point at least 7 days in the future. Once these keys are deleted, there is no way to decrypt data encrypted with them.

**Remediation**

Ensure that the key deletion was planned, and that it will not cause loss of access to sensitive or critical data.
